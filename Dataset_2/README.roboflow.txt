The dataset includes 2122 images.
Objects are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Randomly crop between 0 and 29 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -12 and +12 degrees
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -12째 to +12째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 4.1 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.53 percent of pixels
